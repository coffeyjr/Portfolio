            <p>Below you can find a full list of the projects that I have worked. These projects could either be just for fun, during school, or for a client.</p>
            <!-- ETSU Parking Website -->
            <h2>ETSU Parking</h2>
            <p>This is a project I tackled during my last semester of college in the spring of 2023. I wanted to create something that ETSU students, faculty, and staff could use to improve the way they parked on campus.</p>
            <p>One of the pages includes an interactive map of campus, that I built using JavaScript, with various parking lots outlined, numbered, and color-coded for the right person. Since I didn't have access to the data of the parking lots, the numbers that are generated for how many spots are remaining are randomized.</p>
            <p>The other page includes various links to forms, applications, forms, etc. as well as the parking and traffic regulations brochure.</p>
            <p>I built this website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.</p>

            <!-- TBird Technologies -->
            <h2>TBird Technologies</h2>
            <p>TBird Technologies is an IT Services company located in Greeneville, TN. I offered the owner to make him a website from scratch free of charge.</p>
            <p>This is a 4-page website that includes the home page, services, about, and contact. While doing this website, I was able to learn and gain more experience using media queries.</p>
            <p>I built this website using HTML. CSS. Bootstrap, and JavaScript.</p>
            <a href="https://t-bird-technologies.vercel.app/" class="button">Visit Site</a>

            <!-- Frontend Mentor - Product preview card -->
            <h2>Product preview card</h2>
            <p>My challenge was to build out a product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
            <p>While completing this challenge I was able to utilize Flexbox, media queries, and variables.</p>
